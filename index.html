           <p>  I have worked in skill development and knowledge acquisition for the past four years.
                Working in education and mental health supplies you with a plethora of unique thought application skills such as team building, critical thinking, and acute problem solving tactics.
                I am bringing my altruistic attitude over to the technology field for promotion of software development for the everyday user,
                to not only grow my own prowess but to be a great asset for whom ever I have the oppertunity to work with.
           </p>
           <br> 
           <p> I firmly believe in a what can I do for you mentality.
               Through my rise in software language, codes, and project production I want to always provide what is best for the company as well as the user.
